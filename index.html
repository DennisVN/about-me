        <h5>A FUNNY STORY</h5>
        <h5><em>Once upon a time i was invited to the Bachelor weekend of my friend. My cat stayed at home<br> that weekend. A very unwise burglar decided to break in, having no idea i had a cat. The burglar <br> decides to kick my cat. Fast forward to the morning after i wake up very early (super hungover)<br> by my telephone. It was the police to tell me someone tried to break in, but they caught him,<br> as he was covered in blood from head to toe. My cat wasn't very happy with the kick, <br>so she fought back ! His fingerprints in blood were all over the place, my stolen Imac included,<br> so it was very easy to identify him and get my stuff back.<br> Thanks Tigra !</em></h5>
        <h6>TL;DR</h6>
